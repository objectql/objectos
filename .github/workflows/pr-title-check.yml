            The subject "{subject}" found in the pull request title "{title}"
            doesn't match the configured pattern. Please ensure that the subject
            doesn't start with an uppercase character.

          invalidMessage: |
            ❌ PR title doesn't follow Conventional Commits format.
            
            Expected format: `type(scope): subject`
            
            Examples:
            - `feat(kernel): add hook priority support`
            - `fix(server): handle null values in query`
            - `docs: update architecture guide`
            
            Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
            
            Please update your PR title to match this format.
