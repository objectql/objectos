description: The Business Operating System - Orchestrate Identity, Workflows, and Local-First Sync in one unified runtime. The Kernel for your Enterprise.

ObjectOS is the **Business Operating System** for the ObjectStack ecosystem, providing:

- 🛡️ **Identity & Governance** - Built-in RBAC, SSO (OIDC/SAML), and granular field-level security. Not just a login library, but a complete governance engine.
- ⚙️ **Workflow Orchestration** - Finite State Machines (FSM) as code. Define approval chains and automation rules declaratively in YAML.
- 🔄 **Local-First Sync Engine** - Handles conflict resolution (CRDT/LWW) to keep offline clients in sync with the server.
- 🔌 **Plugin Architecture** - Micro-kernel design. Everything—CRM, HRM, ERP—is just a plugin loaded via a Manifest.
- 🎯 **Declarative Logic** - Business processes defined as metadata, not code. State machines, validation rules, and automation triggers.
- 🏗️ **Three-Layer Architecture** - Clean separation—Kernel handles orchestration, Drivers handle persistence, Server handles protocols.

## The Problem with Traditional Development

You don't build an operating system by writing your own process scheduler and file system from scratch. You use an OS like Linux or Windows.

**So why are you writing your own Auth system, Workflow engine, and Sync logic for every business application?**

Modern enterprise applications suffer from:
- **Microservices Sprawl:** Too many fragmented services with duplicated auth, logging, and data access logic.
- **Spaghetti Monoliths:** Business logic tangled with HTTP handlers, making testing and changes painful.
- **Reinventing Sync:** Every team builds their own half-baked solution for offline-first applications.

## The Solution: ObjectOS as Your Enterprise Kernel

**ObjectOS is the Operating System for your business applications.** It provides the unified Control Plane that orchestrates:

- **Identity & Access:** Centralized authentication and RBAC enforcement
- **Data Synchronization:** Automatic conflict resolution for local-first architectures  
- **Business Processes:** Workflow state machines and automation triggers
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Modular extensions that integrate seamlessly

Think of it as the **kernel layer** between your business logic and infrastructure. Just as Linux manages processes, memory, and I/O, ObjectOS manages identity, state, and synchronization.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectos
cd objectos && pnpm install

# Start the kernel
pnpm dev

# The API is live at http://localhost:3000
# Visit http://localhost:3000/api/metadata to see loaded objects
```
